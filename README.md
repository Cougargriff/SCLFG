#### Starting a LFG android app for the sci-fi game Star Citizen.
This app is meant to serve as a tool for the Star Citizen and fill a gap in the ability for users to connect and play together. The app requires email, password authentication currently. Authenticatin is handled with Google's :fire: FireStore cloud database solution.  

Currently working on group creation.
